## License

This project is part of the OpenClassrooms [Front-End Developer](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/314-developpeur-front-end) course. The code is freely reusable, but the images / logo / figma mock-up do not belong to me.

If you are also an OC student, you can freely draw inspiration from my work, but I obviously do not recommend copying parts of it.
